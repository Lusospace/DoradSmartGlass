* Summary of set up
* Configuration - At first it's needed to bond the SmartPhone and SmartGlass devices together with the bluetooth connection, So turn on the bluetooth on both device and bond the devices natively using default android bluetooth options. Must open Unity application and modify the bluetooth connection parameter to match the smartphone name. 
* Requirement - It's an android application so the minimum version of Android 8.1 is required.
* How to run tests - Clone this repository, modify the connection parameter inside the unity application and then build an android apk and install it or deploy directly to the smartglass.
* To install the apk direclty to the smartglass the android device should have development mode enabled with **USB debugging** turned on and if you use adb to install then it is needed to enable **install via USB** in Developer options.
